## Genre
Top-down twinstick roguelite shooter

## Description
Summer course organized by LapinAMK called "Kesäpeliopinnot 2024" which translates to "Summergamestudies". The course was worth 20 studypoints and took around 3 months.<br>
The goal of the course was to make a game (either complete or demo) with gameplay trailer<br>
This Repository is Clone from original repository that was provided by organizing school.

## Project status
Development has stopped completely, since this project was tied to a school project.<br>
So this game is as ready as it will ever be. We will not be adding possible cut contents like boss fight and we are not going to fix any possible bugs.
